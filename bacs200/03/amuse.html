    <h2>Funniest Simpsons memes</h2>
    <p>The simpsons have some of the funniest memes that I have ever seen. Some of their episodes have been known to "predict the future" such as President Trump, and the whole Area 51 raid.</p>

    <h2>FailArmy</h2>
    <p>FailArmy has some of the funniest content reguarding when people fail. Fails include things such as trampoline breaks, tripping, falling, and so much more. Some of the funniest fails are when people slip and fall or when people try to take their trucks through a huge mud hole and get stuck or break their truck.</p>
