He continues to learn new concepts every day from a multitude of different programming langueages such as Python, Java, C#, and currently HTML, and CSS.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    Some of the hobbies that Sean enjoys doing, are golfing, running, cooking, and recently discovered a love for camping. Sean and his girlfriend of 4 years, went camping back in September to Grand Lake, CO. Sean and Grace really enjoyed their trip and saw some of the most beautiful colored leaves that they had ever seen.
