<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Sean Strawmatt is a sophmore at the University of Northern Colorado. He is currently pursuing a bachelors degree in software engineering. He continues to learn new concepts every day from a multitude of different programming langueages such as Python, Java, C#, and currently HTML and CSS. Sean is the first in his family to attend a university with a four year degree. He makes his family proud by trying his best and working extremely hard. Other than school related things, Sean lives his life to the fullest. When not in class, Sean is often outside running, doing some sort of physical labor, or working on his golf swing. Last summer, Sean scored an awesome job as a maintenance crew member at a golf course near his house in Aurora. He has often said that the golf course is the best job that he has ever had because he developed a deeper love for the game, as well as a deeper understanding of gold course matinence and the outdoors. Sean started work at 5 AM, but Sean said that getting up early is well worth the beautiful morning view.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    Some of the hobbies that Sean enjoys doing are golfing, running, cooking, and recently discovered a love for camping. Sean, and his girlfriend of 4 years, went camping back in September to Grand Lake, CO. Sean and Grace really enjoyed their trip and saw some of the most beautiful colored leaves that they had ever seen. Camping provides a whole new level of respect and love for the outdoors. There is something that is so peaceful about unplugging for a few days and being away from everyone. Another benefit of camping is cooking over the campfire. Sean and Grace grilled up the best steaks that they ever had, along with some pretty good burgers, and other delicious foods.

    Here are just a few pictures of the golf course from early in the morning, just as the sun is coming up. The beauty of the rising sun cannot be fully captured in images, however, it gives the impression of what it was like.
