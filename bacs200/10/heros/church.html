        Eric Church is another one of my heroes becasue I have been listening to his music ever since I was in elementary school. I don't like much country music but I think that his music is awesome. I think Eric Church is one of my heros, because I can really connect with a lot of his music. Everyone has a lot of artits and musicians that they like and connect with, but Eric Church has to be on of my top five.
