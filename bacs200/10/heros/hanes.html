        Cameron Hanes is one of my heroes, because he just pushes for hard work and dedication. There aren't too many people in today's age where you learn about them to push and strive for everything that it takes. Hanes is a professional bow hunter and he trains hard everysingle day so that he has what it takes to take on the hunt.
