    <h1>The Heroes of My Life</h1>
    <p>Below are a few of the people who I idolize as heroes below. People whom I look up to and have taught me a lot of things throughout my life. These are people who I look up to for inspiration, the drive to work harder than ever, who I am as a person, and some were just part of my childhood upringing. </p>

        About Me
        <p>
            Sean Strawmatt is a sophmore at the University of Northern Colorado. He is currently pursuing a bachelors in software engineering. He continues to learn new concepts every day from a multitude of different programming langueages such as Python, Java, C#, and currently HTML, and CSS. Last summer Sean got a job at a golf course near his house and found a whole new level of respect for golf course maintenance, and the game itself. When summer time is here, Sean will be found on the driving range working on his swing.
