    <h1>The Heroes of My Life</h1>
    <p>Below are a few of the people who I idolize as heroes below. People whom I look up to and have taught me a lot of things throughout my life. These are people who I look up to for inspiration, the drive to work harder than ever, who I am as a person, and some were just part of my childhood upringing. </p>
