    <h2>Accordion on interesting things</h2>

    <button class="accordion">Golf</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Golf is one of the most interesting games to play. It is more of a mental game than a physical game. Many people aren't too fond of golf, but if you really have a passion for it, it is a game that you will play for the rest of your life. Golf is a game where the only way you lose, is when you put your clubs down. If you break a hundred or two hundred, that just means that there is room for improvement. Golf is something that I will play for the rest of my life. </p>

    <button class="accordion">Software</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The more I learn about software engineering and how it works, the more I realize that software is everywhere in today's world. There is software in the newest cars and trucks, houses, and even something as simple as a crosswalk. The moment that you push that button, a whole connection of software is set off and recognizes that someone pushed that button to cross the street. It is amazing how software is everywhere. I have even heard professionals speak about software and they said that almost every single company today, is a software comapny. It does not matter what product or industry they are in, they are a software company. </p>

    <button class="accordion">Travel</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>One of my goals in my life is to travel to a lot of different countries. The summer of 2017, I took the most amazing trip that I have ever been on to the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador. It was a science school trip and it really opened my eyes to places other than the United States. I saw some of the most amazing wildife that I have ever seen, had some of the best food, and saw how other cultures lived their day to day lives. I want to expand my mind even more and travel to places such as Australia, Ireland, Tanzania, and many more. I belive that if you don't travel in your life, then you don't really have any idea as to what is out there in the world. </p>
        <p>Here are a few pics from the Galapagos. </p>

        Heres a cool video on an "introduction" to software.

        If you've never been into travel, this might change your mind.
