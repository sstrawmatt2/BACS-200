This project is for the milestone 1 or the basic page structure project. I'm creating a page for the people who I 
consider to be my heroes in life. I am going to add in a stylesheet to give the page some color and give it some
different fonts so that it looks a little bit more professionsal.

For milestone 2, I want to create a carousel of some of the places that my girlfreind have been over the past few years. I want to 
have about five or so images that can be diplayed and just cycle through. 


Milestone 3: I'm not really sure what I want to demonstrate yet but I think I will come up with 
something cool hopefully.
