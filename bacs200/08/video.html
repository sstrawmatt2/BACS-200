        There are many different categories of "the dangers of technology", but I wanted to highlight on how technology is taking over the smaller bussiness world, and how it affects children growing up. Technology is constantly taking over jobs such as fast food, car washes, movie theatres, and much more. Technology can be extremely dangerous when it is in the hands of some children. This is becuase children who spend their whole childhood hooked to a tablet or laptop, don't really know what it means to be a kid. Growing up being outside on a bike and away from a computer, can really help someone learn and grow.
