            What does it take to be motivated? To be motivated, it means that you want something a lot more than someone else does. It means that you are willing to do what it takes to get to your goal. No good person has been able to sit by and let things happen for them. They have had to put in the hard work, spend countless hours on it, and push through the long stressful days and nights to get the task done.

            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - taking the time out of their lives to share their knowledge </li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impacts have caused them to work extremely hard and long hours to do what it takes to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>

            For the past few years, I have been watching a lot of Jocko Willink's videos and reading a few of his books. Jocko is a retired Navy SEAL, and the wisdom that he shares on what dedication and motivation mean, have really spoke to me within the past few years. I've also had to learn the hard way that nothing comes easy, and if you want something then you have to earn it.
